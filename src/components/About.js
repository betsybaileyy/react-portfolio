      <h1>About Betsy</h1>
      <p>Betsy began coding in January of 2018 and has been hooked ever since. She’s spent most of her time building web applications in JavaScript utilizing Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, and React as frameworks. Since arriving at Make School, Betsy has begun learning about data structures and how to write code in Python to develop software. Her ultimate goal is to learn about human connection and communication in order to develop software that enables us to better communicate with and understand each other. Betsy might have found her passion in software development, however, she doesn’t spend all of her time coding. When she’s not trying to solve a bug in her code, you can find her spending time with her dog or enjoying the outdoors with friends (and maybe watching a little Netflix, too.)</p>
